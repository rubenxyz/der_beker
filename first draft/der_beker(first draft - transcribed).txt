INT - BAKERY - NIGHT
YOSEL(62) has just thrown the meat knishes into the oven.

!We hear a bell ring, as if someone came through the front door.
Yosel glances at his arm watch, mutters to himself.

YOSEL
(shouting)
You wont get extra hours just because you come in early, schmolke!

He shakes his head, wipes his hand of a rag, walks towards the door.
But Stops in his tracks, a man is standing by the door.

YOSEL
Oy, gevalt. You scared me. Sorry for shouting, thought you were…

THE MAN is nicely dressed, and with a big smile.

Yosel gets back to work.

MAN
Hope I’m not intruding.

YOSEL
Well, I’m afraid we don't open until six.

MAN
I’m not a customer

YOSEL
Oh, yeah? Then who are you?

MAN
I hope I’m not disturbing. I was here last afternoon but Say said you had left for the day.

YOSEL
Come in early, leave early. That is the life of a baker. So what can I do you for?

The man just smiles back at the baker. The baker stops and looks at him, anticipating.

MAN
Yosel… don't you remember me?

Yosel looks at him, thinks.

YOSEL
no, not really?

MAN
It’s me! VELVEL?

YOSEL
Velvel?

VELVEL
Yes, Velvel.

YOSEL
Velvel?

VELVEL
Velvel.

YOSEL
Little, Velvel?

VELVEL
Yes!

YOSEL
My lord, Lofkes boy?

VELVEL gives him a big smile, Yosel thinks, then returns to his chores.

VELVEL
Well, it was nice to find you in good health.

YOSEL
You too.

Yosel looks Velvel up and down.

YOSEL
Looks like you’ve done well for yourself.

VELVEL
I’m doing alright, I’m a businessman now.

YOSEL
Businessman?

VELVEL
Yes.

YOSEL
WHat Business?

VELVEL
Oh, this and that. Mostly Textiles.

YOSEL
Textiles? Last thing I heard you took off with the collection from _____

VELVEL
Oh that was just a teenage prank.

YOSEL
A prank? We never saw you again.

VELVEL
I went to Gothenburg.

YOSEL
Well, you got some nerve showing yourself in this town.

Velvel just looks at Yosel.

YOSEL
Not that I’m sorry for what your father did to you and your siblings.

VELVEL
WHat doesn't kill you, right?

YOSEL
So what brings you back to Borås?

VELVEL
Well, I came here for business.

YOSEL
You don’t say, let me know if you find any.

VELVEL
I’ve been quite successful lately and garnered the attention of some important people.

YOSEL
Really?

VELVEL
Yes, I had a meeting yesterday with Mr.Urwitz

Yosel looks at Velvel, gaping.

YOSEL
You be careful with that guy.

VELVEL
Mr.Urwitz is actually a great man, despite what people say.

Yosel’s casual demeanor is replaced with something more frightened. 

YOSEL
Yes, I’m sure.

VELVEL
He has done quite well for himself.

YOSEL
Does he know that you are here?

VELVEL
I didn't say that much, but I’ve taken upon myself to explore potentially new business venture for Mr.Urwitz.

YOSEL
Really?

VELVEL
That is what brings me here, I came to give you an offer.

INT. BAKERY - MOMENT LATER
YOSEL and VELVEL are sitting by a table. Yosel pours some coffee for Velvel.

VELVEL
So what are your costs? You’ve got rent, electricity, flour, sugar, staff, taxes, etc etc. I saw some of the prices I came in. I think you could up the price tag by at least a couple of kronor.

YOSEL
I’ve tried that but the customers just goes to Belka. Trust me, I’ve been doing this for fifty six years.

VELVEL
I’m not worried by that.

YOSEL
What do you mean?

VELVEL
Don’t worry about Belka, that’s what I mean.

YOSEL
Don’t worry?

VELVEL
Yes.

Yosel looks at Velvel, wondering.

YOSEL
So what are you saying?

VELVEL
Raise your prices.

Yosel looks at him in awe.

VELVEL
Believe me, it will be alright.

YOSEL
Sure, I’ll think about it. Nice of you to come by, if you don't mind I have -
Yosel is about to get out of his seat.

VELVEL
NO, I’m not done.

YOSEL
Ok.

Yosel sits back down.

VELVEL
With the increased income you would be able to afford additional security.

Velvel’s words makes Yosel’s eyes lit up, frightened. Velvet looks back at him, confidently.

YOSEL
You know I really appreciate you taking time out to-

VELVEL
-with the additonal revenue, your business would be more profitable-

YOSEL
I’m just a simple baker, there’s really no money in this-

VELVEL
BEing more profitable, the bakery could be more susceptible to crime. 

YOSEL
I’ve been toiling away here for fifty six years, I’m scraping by-

VELVEL
With my connections and extensive network, I would ensure the security the premise, supplies, staff and the owner.

YOSEL
I can’t tell you how much I appreciate - 

VELVEL
This collaboration would deter delayed payments.

YOSEL
That’s really nice of you but…

VELVEL
Outstanding balances.

YOSEL
Everybody pays, sooner or later.

VELVEL
Sabotage.

YOSEL
You are too kind making this offer…

VELVEL
Vandalism.

YOSEL
Isnt there something else that could be worked-

VELVEL
Arson!

Yosel is stunned. Velvel let’s words sink in while he smirks at Yosel. The two men look at each other for a beat. Yosel throws himself on his knees before Velvel.

YOSEL
(crying)
I’ve worked to build up this bakery my entire life.

Yosel grabs a hold of Velvel’s coat, to his dismay.

YOSEL
Please, I beg you.

VELVEL
Get off me!

YOSEL
I’m saving up for my daughters dowry.

VELVEL
Get your hands off me!

YOSEL
Please! Don’t do this to me!

Velvel pushes Yosel off him, too the floor where he curls up and sobs.

VELVEL
Get a grip on yourself!

Velvel brushes the flour off his fine coat, disgusted.

Yosel weeps into his hands.

VELVEL
Have some respect for yourself!

YOSEL
(to the ceiling)
WHY? WHY?!

Velvel looks down at him, contemptuously. He leans forward.

VELVEL
Have you ever gotten away with something you shouldn’t have?

Yosel looks up at him, confused.

YOSEL
(to self)
Don’t do this.

!A beeping alarm goes off across the room.

YOSEL
Oy, my knishes.

Yosel wipes tears, gets up and blows his nose on his way to the owen.

VELVEL
What kind of Knishes do you got there?

Yosel opens the oven and takes out the trays.

YOSEL
Eh… beef.

VELVEL
Are they good?

YOSEL
The best on this side of the baltic sea.

VELVEL
Oh, yeah? I’ll be the judge of that.

YOSEL
What, you want one?

VELVEL
Yeah, bring it over.

YOSEL
Ok, just a minute.

Yosel reaches for a box on his shelf. Velvel sees a stain on his and starts scraping it with his nail

YOSEL
So how long are you in town for?

VELVEL
Oh, just over the day.

YOSEL
And then back to gothenburg?

VELVEL
I have some business in Örebro.

YOSEL
Wow, you get around.

Yosel comes back to Velvel with a knish on a plate.

VELVEL
Wow, look at this. 

YOSEL
Be careful, it’s piping hot.

Velvel takes a fork and cuts it up.

VELVEL
Smells good.

YOSEL
Straight out of the owen.

Velvel blows on a piece of the knish, on the fork.

VELVEL
While I’m waiting, get me the books would ya?

YOSEL
The books?

VELVEL
The accounting!

YOSEL
Oh, yeah.

INT BAKERY - MOMENTS LATER

YOSEL watches on as VELVEL goes bookkeeping.
Velvel maunders the numbers to himself as he skims through the pages.
He finishes the last bite of the knish and closes the binder.

VELVEL
Well, we definitely need to get these numbers up.

YOSEL
I’m barely getting by.

VELVEL
I’m afraid you just gotta work harder.

YOSEL
I’m here three, every morning.

VELVEL
I guess you just have to stick around later then.

YOSEL
But I’m not a kid anymore, by two o'clock I’m-
VELVEL
Don't give me that crap. YOu better watch your mouth when you talk to your business partner.

YOSEL
Whatever you say.

VELVEL
We are raising prices, turning up productivity and cutting costs.

Velvel pounds his chest with his fist.

YOSEL
You alright?

VELVEL
Yeah I’m fine. Damn that was a good knish. Anyways, you are working for me now!

Yosel looks back at him, meekly.

VELVEL
So every sunday I’ll send my guy over to pick up the payments.

Yosel nods

VELVEL
The money should be in as big bills as possible, you put it in a bron paper bag. It should be ready for pick up at exactly nine zero zero in the morning.

YOSEL
Nine in the morning.

VELVEL
Nine in the morning. Not a minute later.

YOSEL
Yes, sir. Not a minute later.

VELVEL 
I want clean bills in the bag. You’ll put a cover sheet for the weeks transactions, your costs.

YOSEL
My costs.

VELVEL
Your sales.

YOSEL
My sales.

VELVEL
and make you sure that you…

YOSEL
Yes?

VELVEL
You make sure that…

Velvel looks around the room, squinting.

YOSEL
You alright, boss?

Velvel looks disoriented.

YOSEL
You look pale.

Velvel, in his delirium, glances down at the plate on the table. Now just holding a couple of crumbs, he looks back up at yosel before dropping to the floor.

Yosel looks down at Velvel on the floor, unmoved.
Yosel draws a big sigh.

YOSEL
(to himself)
Oy, oy, oy.

YOSEL stands up, grabs the body by the armpits and drags him across the bakery. He passes the oven and on a table we see a syringe a and a brown medicine bottle.

INT - WALK IN FREEZER 
The fluorescent lights continuously flicker on and reveal two frozen men hanging on hooks.
YOSEL comes in, dragging VELVELs body, and dumps it on the floor.

YOSEL
Don’t go anywhere.

He chuckles.

Outside the walk in freezer, Yosel dusts off his hands, chuckles to himself and leaves the frame.
